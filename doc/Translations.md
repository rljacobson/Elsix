How to translate the language of an overly combative colleague. 

| What they said | What it means |
|:---------------|:--------------|
| "Why would you use X?" | "I do not understand X" |
| "Only an idiot would use X." | "I am masking my insecurity and ignorance about X with aggression." |
| "You should obviously use Y instead of X." | "I understand Y. If we shift the conversation to Y I can feel powerful again." |
